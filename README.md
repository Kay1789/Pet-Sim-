🐾 Pet Sim – Updated Version 2.0

Yo, this is my upgraded pet sim from yesterday!
I added some cool new stuff today like energy levels and a sleep function, so your pet’s gotta chill sometimes or else it’ll suffer the consequences 🥱💀.

I’m still kinda winging polymorphism, pointers, and enums, but I’m learning as I go — no cap.

🎮 What It Does

Adopt a pet (dog, cat, hamster, bunny) with name, color, and age

Feed, play, sleep, or check stats for your pet

Pet’s mood, hunger, and energy levels change based on what you do

Ignore your pet too much and it might die from hunger or lack of sleep 😭

Pets have unique sounds and reactions thanks to polymorphism



---

🧠 What I Used

Enums for pet type, color, mood, hunger, and energy (way cleaner than tons of if’s)

OOP with inheritance + virtual functions for pet behaviors

Polymorphism so pets act different when they speak, sleep, or get annoyed

Dynamic memory with new and delete (finally got that down)

Switch statements for cleaner control flow

While(true) game loop for the menu system

Used toupper() for input flexibility



---

💀 Warnings

If hunger hits starvation 3 times during play, your pet dies 💀

If energy gets too low (dead inside level) 3 times without sleep, your pet also dies from exhaustion

Take care of your virtual buddy or face the consequences 😤

💻 How To Use

1. Copy the full code into PetSim.cpp


2. Compile it with:

g++ PetSim.cpp -o PetSim


3. Run it:

./PetSim

😎 Why I Made This Update

Yesterday’s version was cool but basic AF, so today I:

Added energy levels to make pets more realistic

Created a SleepPet() function and sleep behaviors for each pet

Made pets respond differently when they’re sleepy or annoyed

Improved the menu with new sleep option Z

Made death happen both from starvation AND exhaustion


It’s still the same fun pet sim, just now with more personality and challenge.

🧪 Future Stuff (maybe lol)

Save pet stats to a file and load later

More moods, actions, and sounds (because why not?)

Add a health bar or more detailed pet stats

Switch to vectors for dynamic arrays once I stop being scared of them 😭
