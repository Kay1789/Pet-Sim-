🐾 Pet Sim – Updated Version

So yeah... this is my updated version of the pet sim I made earlier 😤
I rewrote a bunch of stuff, added pointers, cleaned it up a bit, and used polymorphism (without fully studying it lol). Still learned a lot on the way tho.

🎮 What It Does

You adopt a pet (dog, cat, hamster, or bunny)

Give it a name, color, and age

You can feed, play, or check stats

It has mood and hunger levels that change depending on what you do

If you mess up too much and ignore it — your pet dies 💀



---

🧠 What I Used

Enums for pet mood, hunger, type, color (way cleaner than if spam)

OOP (class inheritance + virtual functions)

Polymorphism — pet reacts differently depending on type

new and delete for dynamic memory (I actually remembered this time 😭)

Switch cases instead of long-ass if chains

Good ol’ while (true) game loop for the menu



---

💀 Warnings

If hunger drops too low 3 times (while playing), your pet just... dies.
Don’t say I didn’t warn you 👀



---

💻 How To Use

1. Paste the code in a file like PetSim.cpp


2. Compile it (I used g++):

g++ PetSim.cpp -o PetSim


3. Run it:

./PetSim

😎 Why I Made This Update

So I made the first version yesterday and looked at it again today like…
“Okay this is cool but also kinda basic 💀”
So I cleaned it up — added virtual functions, used pointers instead of manually making objects, made everything more organized, and added some flavor to the gameplay.
It’s still the same pet sim idea, but now it’s ✨fancier✨ and actually uses some proper C++ stuff.

🧪 Future Stuff (maybe lol)

Saving pet stats to a file

Adding more moods or actions

A pet health bar? IDK

Maybe use vector someday when I understand it 💀
